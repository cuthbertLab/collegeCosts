                <p class="text-left">Click any name to learn more from the Dept. of Education.  Costs include
                room and board but do not include the costs paid by people who did not apply

            <p class="text-left">Colleges are sorted by SAT <b>25th</b> percentile (not mean/median). Why?
            Too many of us see an average number and think, "well, I can't go there, my
            score is not high enough." Guess what? 50% of all students are below the
            median, so someone's got to get in.  In fact, 1/4 of all students will have
            a below 25th percentile score, so it can certainly be worth applying even if your scores
            are below the numbers given there if this is a dream school.</p>

                Note that some schools will show unusual cost "discontinuities" especially at levels
                where there aren't enough applicants to generate true averages (generally at the
                lowest and highest income levels).  In some cases, people with the lowest
                incomes are listed as needing to pay more than the next higher level; my own
                interpretation of this data is that probably some well-off families are able to
                report little or no income (due to foreign investments, family trusts, etc.) and thus
                would be grouped with the lowest income families. If it seems too odd to be true,
                it probably is. (However, some of those amazing deals <b>are</b> true).
                </p>

		  Since the pandemic, many schools are no longer reporting average SAT/ACT data
		  or are not accepting the exams.  There are good reasons to do so, but it makes
		  deciding if a college is realistic more difficult.  In those cases, the 2016
		  SAT data is listed with a "<b>~</b>" mark.  The same mark is used for schools
		  that list only median SATs but not 25th percentile.

                The lack of a feature to show all schools regardless of costs is  
                <b class="accent">on purpose</b>.
                If a school is pricing itself way out of the range of average families, maybe
                it deserves to be ignored?
